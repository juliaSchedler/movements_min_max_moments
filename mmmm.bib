	abstract = {Efficient exploratory data analysis (EDA) may be aided by succinct, but informative, graphical representations (e.g., Tukey plots) that convey information about central tendency, variability, and shape of distributions, and that permit detection of outliers. Using research strategies adapted from studies of cross-modal perceptual equivalence, we show how auditory analogies of such displays may offer an effective alternative to visual plots for EDA.},

	abstract = {A single experiment studied how effectively information about the central tendency, variability, and shape of numeric data distributions could be conveyed to statistically knowledgeable subjects. The data were summarized by visual histograms, auditory histograms that coded numeric value as pitch on the musical scale, and five-note auditory analogues of a box-whisker display that coded the minimum, quartile, and maximum scores as musical notes. Regression and multidimensional scaling analysis of judgments of dissimilarity between distributions showed that auditory depiction provides a highly effective means of conveying information about distributional characteristies. Auditory depicition may be a useful alternative to traditional visual graphics.},

	abstract = {Two experiments are presented that compare the effectiveness of different parameters of sound for the auditory presentation of box plots. Temporal mapping was found to be better than pitch or panning mapping. In the first experiment, the mapping condition that used two dimensions (the redundant condition) did not result in a better performance than those mappings that used one dimension. However, subjects showed a strong preference for the redundant condition. Finally, subjects’ overall level was not very high and performance did not increase with practice as much as might have been expected.},

	abstract = {Although there are various ways to represent data patterns and models, visualization has been primarily taught in many data science courses for its efficiency. Such vision-dependent output may cause critical barriers against those who are blind and visually impaired and people with learning disabilities. We argue that instructors need to teach multiple data representation methods so that all students can produce data products that are more accessible. In this paper, we argue that accessibility should be taught as early as the introductory course as part of the data science curriculum so that regardless of whether learners major in data science or not, they can have foundational exposure to accessibility. As data science educators who teach accessibility as part of our lower-division courses in two different institutions, we share specific examples that can be utilized by other data science instructors.},

	abstract = {An experiment is presented comparing the effectiveness of three parameters of sound for the auditory presentation of statistical data or auditory graphs. The dimensions of pitch, loudness, and time were used alone and redundantly to map the values of a box plot to an auditory graph. While previously, temporal mappings had resulted in better performance than mappings using pitch, panning, or loudness, these benefits were not consistently found in the current paradigm. Furthermore, to investigate possible benefits of mappings using two dimensions redundantly over mappings using one dimension, this experiment, compared mappings using integral and separable dimensions of sound - specifically, pitch and loudness (integral) and pitch and timing (separable). There was a benefit of a redundant design when the dimensions of sound used were integral whereas there was no benefit when they were separable. Finally, a task closer to a real-life application of auditory graphs was used where two sources of information were monitored simultaneously. The results support the argument that auditory graphs can be used effectively in “eyes busy” situations where more than one source of information is being monitoring.},
