### California Coastal Classroom Research Collaborative

We are incredibly grateful to the feedback from our C3RC collaborations, Dr. Jeanine Scaramozzino, Dr. Aaron Liggett, and Annica Wu (the artist behind the poppy art on the event fliers and the video!).

Further information is available on the [3CRC Webpage](https://guides.lib.calpoly.edu/steam) (under construction).

### Additional Acknowledgements

Additional gratitude to everyone on the math department side of the 2nd floor of faculty offices east, especially Dr. Charlotte Mann and Dr. Ulric Lund, for listening to and/or being annoyed by drafts of the sonifications.

And finally, I am extremely grateful to the funding organization within Cal Poly, unfortunately I did not get my ducks in a row so I will need to update with that information later. ðŸ¦†
